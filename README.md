<h1>Accelerate challenge</h1>

<h2>Building the basic code and first steps</h2

<p>When I started to design the website, it was very humble, a liitle diagram of how I wanted it to look like.</p>
<p>After creating a basic html file, I began by populating the headers and footer elements.</p>
<p>Then I started to create my sections within the body of the page following this I put in the textual information, including headers.</p>

<p>At this stage I probably should've styled my page, but I went on to add photos and kept getting distracted by their impact on the page.</p>

<h2>Images, proper alignment with grids and functions</h2>

<p>Adding the images was easy and didn't take alot of time, however the creation and alignment of coloumns was a challenge as the pictures would not go into the right coloumn.</p>
<p>After a lot of experimentation I figured it out and it was worked wonders. So I began to work on the JavaScript aspect of the page.</p>

<h2>Functions and styling</h2>

<p>Getting to grips with the terminology of JavaScript was propbably the most difficult part of the site, but it allowed me to generate a library and then display a couple of elements. This means that the page is not overloaded at the begining of loading, people view the site can look at additional pictures in the library by pressing show more.</p>

<p>Styling the page was not easy either, but only due to messy name spaces on my part, in the future I'll keep a better track of my elemeng tags.<p>
