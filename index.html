                <h3>Brief History</h3>
                <p>I was born and rasied in Hong Kong, however I didn't grow up in the city, I lived on Discovery Bay where I was exposed to the great outdoors. I went to Kennedy and then to West Island School while in Hong Kong, following this I went to the University of Kent to study history.</p>
                <p>Following university I worked in food and beverage, and eventually opened the Beach House. After the hours became too much I started to teach English, though this was fulfilling it was not for me. </p>
                <p>Since I was lucky enough to go to an international school I have experianced many cultures and been exposed to various beliefs as well as foods. Enjoying the culture is an important part of travelling and therefore when I travel I tend to delve into the local cuisine.</p>
